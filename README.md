# Minecraft-Server-File-Maker
## Make sure you save a copy of the Server Start.bat and/or settings.bat
It makes minecraft server files with custom ram amounts

You need to delete or move any Server Start.bat files and settings.bat files.
After that you can use do what ever you want with the tool.
Tested on Valhelsia_SERVER-2.2.10 & SevTech-Ages_Server_3.1.7 | works on both of them.

I initialy added support for ngrok to auto start, and a button to install ngrok. Probably will put them back in.
